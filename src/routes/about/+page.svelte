            The Office for Student Ethics is a disciplinary body formed to help promote ethical student behavior and the values of Honor and Integrity as necessary complements to the pursuit of Academic Excellence, Social Responsibility, and Personal Development.

    <p class="font-medium">
        This simple but profound question lies at the heart of the transformation that gave birth to the Office for Student Ethics (OSE) at UP Diliman. 
        In a university that upholds honor and excellence, character is not imposed. It is chosen, owned, and nurtured. 
        The history of the OSE is more than a shift in office names, it unravels a deeper philosophical shift in how we understand discipline, 
        not as punishment, but as restorative and transformative education.

    <p class="font-medium md:ml-25 md:mr-25">
        The origins of the Office for Student Ethics date back to 1976, with the establishment of the Student Disciplinary Tribunal (SDT). 
        Then, student discipline in UP Diliman was litigious in nature, heavily patterned after legal procedures. 
        The SDT was closely tied to the Diliman Legal Office and echoed the courtroom setup, with lawyers, and formal adjudications. 
        This reflected a time when discipline was seen as an external imposition rather than an internal opportunity for growth. 
        However, not all cases fit neatly into this adversarial model. In 2003, the University recognized the specific need for a more focused mechanism to address sexual harassment. 
        Thus, the Office of Anti-Sexual Harassment (OASH) was created following the Anti-Sexual Harassment Code passed on December 11, 2003. 
        OASH handled these sensitive cases with a trauma-informed approach, distinct from the broader mandate of the SDT.

    </div>
    <p class="md:ml-20 md:mr-20">
        By 2014, a significant structural and philosophical shift occurred. The SDT evolved into the Student Disciplinary Council (SDC). 
        This change reduced the formal role of legal counsels, reflecting a desire to move away from adversarialism and toward a more educational model. 
        The SDC emphasized community norms and peer accountability, better aligning with the university's identity as a community of scholars. 
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
        The most radical transformation came in 2019, when the UP Board of Regents renamed the SDC to the Office for Student Ethics (OSE). 
        This wasn't just a rebranding, it was a reframing. The new office was designed to integrate research and training module development into its mandate, shifting the entire orientation from punitive measures to restorative justice and ethical development. 
        The OSE now works actively to educate and reorient students toward responsible and ethical agency.

    <p>
        UP Diliman is not a court of law; it is a university with a community of autonomous and thinking individuals. We are not here to brand students with metaphorical scarlet letters, as in Hawthorne’s dystopic tale. Instead, the OSE stands for healing, accountability, and reintegration. Its restorative nature allows for Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in minor cases, especially those occurring outside the jurisdiction of individual colleges. This means fewer hearings and more dialogue, less litigation and more learning.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through these changes, the Office for Student Ethics affirms that discipline is not just about correcting behavior. It’s about building character through ethical reflection, and championing community responsibility. We hold ourselves, and each other, to a higher standard because we are scholars. And scholars do not hide behind rules, they live by principles.
    </p>
    <p>
        So again, we ask: <span class="text-[#0A4624] font-extrabold">Who are we when no one is watching?</span> At UP Diliman, the answer is clear: We are ethical agents, shaping not just our futures, but the moral fabric of our university and society.
